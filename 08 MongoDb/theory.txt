While MongoDB itself is schemaless, defining a schema with Mongoose provides benefits such as validation, ease of use, middleware support, plugins, and type casting, which can simplify and streamline the development of Node.js applications that use MongoDB as the underlying database.

Here's why you might use Mongoose's mongoose.model despite MongoDB being schemaless:

Validation: Mongoose allows you to define a schema for your data model, including data types and validation rules. This enables you to  enforce constraints on the data stored in MongoDB, such as required fields, data types, and custom validation logic. By defining a schema, you can ensure that your data adheres to a certain structure, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being stored in the database.

Ease of Use: Mongoose provides a higher level of abstraction over the MongoDB Node.js driver, making it easier to work with MongoDB in Node.js applications. The mongoose.model method allows you to define and work with data models in a way that is familiar to developers who are used to working with traditional relational databases and ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers).

Middleware: Mongoose allows you to define middleware functions that are executed before or after certain operations, such as save, update, and remove. This enables you to implement pre- and post-processing logic, such as data normalization, validation, and business logic, in a modular and organized manner.

Plugins: Mongoose supports plugins, which are reusable pieces of functionality that can be applied to multiple models. Plugins allow you to encapsulate and reuse common functionality across different parts of your application, such as timestamping, soft deletes, and data encryption.

Type Casting: Mongoose automatically performs type casting and conversion of data between JavaScript types and MongoDB types based on the schema definition. This can help prevent unexpected type-related errors and inconsistencies in your application.
